### RPE RACE

I took retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) RNA from an untreated 211fl/fl mouse (P1) and a 211fl/fl mouse (P2) that was injected with AAV-cre.

I performed nested RACE on these samples and sent the PCR products for sequencing.

It was run on a MiSeq.

Fastq files were aligned to the GRCm38 mouse genome with hisat2 (v2.2.1) and counted with featureCounts (subread v2.0.1).

Downstream analysis was performed with R and the DESeq2 package.

Because there was only one sample in each run as a pilot, DESeq2 didn't really know what to do with the data, so I duplicated each sample and had it run a Wald test.

Unfortunately, when I plotted the data, there were 3000+ DEGs, and the volcano plot also testifies to the fact that my study was underpowered.

I did make a heatmap, though the ENSEMBL IDs were pretty useless as well.

I put the ENSEMBL IDs into [this website](https://biotools.fr/mouse/ensembl_symbol_converter) to generate a gene symbol list of the top 30 DEGs that are in the heatmap:

| ENSMUSG00000090942 | F830016B08Rik |
| ENSMUSG00000027088 | Phospho2      |

Of note, Gnat1 is highly expressed in the neural retina, and RPE65 is highly expressed in the RPE. Gnat1 may have been a hit because of a sample contamination.

Alla in all, this was probably not the correct way to investigate this question, but I will continue investigating the dataset.
